## Description 

(The "add a burger" functionality doesn't work quite yet, but I am writing this as if it does.)

This is a simple application where you can log what burgers you've eaten or plan on eating. You can write down any burger that you plan on eating anytime soon. Then, once you've successfully eaten it, all you have to do is press the button that appears next to it and voila! It will appear as being eaten.  

I have deployed the Heroku Link below.
